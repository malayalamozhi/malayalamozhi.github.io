# Characteristics

* Abugida: All consonants have an inherent 'a' vowel. Diacritics or vowel markers can appear before, after, above or below a consonant.
* Direction: left to right
* Vowels: The vowels also have an independent form, and it is used when they appear at the beginning of a syllable.
* Conjuncts: Conjuncts occur when a consonants join together, some consonants have special markers which denotes their presence.
* Chillu: Chilleluttukal (ചില്ലെഴുത്തുകള്‍) is a special feature of Malayalam orthography. Chillus are independent pure consonants that lack the inherent vowel.

## Vowels (ഉയിരെഴുത്തുകള്‍)

The Malayalam orthography includes 5 short vowels and 5 long vowels, two diphthongs and a rarely used (as seperate) Sanskrit vowel.

* ഋ, അം, അഃ, ഔ are Sanskrit loans. 
* അഃ is rare in Malayalam, and native speakers do not pronounce the sound accurately. 

### Diphthongs

**ഐ** [ai] /ai/ - can be supplemented with **അയി**.

**ഔ** [ou] /ou/

### Diacritics (vowel & diphthong markers)

| vowel | marker    | vowel | marker |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| അ     | no marker | ആ     | ാ      |
| ഇ     | ി         | ഈ     | ീ      |
| ഉ     | ു          | ഊ     | ൂ       |
| എ     | െ         | ഏ     | േ      |
| ഒ     | ൊ         | ഓ     | ോ      |
| ഐ     | ൈ         | ഔ     | ൗ      |
| ഋ     | ൃ          |       |        |

## Consonants (മെയ്യഴുത്തുകള്‍)

There are 35 main consonants in Malayalam. Due to Sanskrit loan words Malayalam have aspirates, these are pronounced with a strong burst of breath. However, it is highly unlikely that you will hear a native speaker accurately pronouncing these aspirate consonants during a normal conversation.

### Nasals

**മ ന ണ ഞ ങ**

* It is to be noted that Malayalam is the only major Dravidian language that distinguishes the 6 Dravidian nasal sounds correctly. 

* ന includes two phonemes, dental na and alveolar na (as in 'pan'). This difference has been preserved in all the earlier writing systems of Malayalam. Although there is a letter ഩ to denote the alveolar na, It is restricted to scholarly usage.

## Chillu letters (ചില്ലെഴുത്തുകള്‍)

  Chillu letters are pure consonants, and are widely used in Malayalam writing.

* ന്‍ is always an alveolar n. 

  <br>

## Conjunct letters

Malayalam uses conjunct consonants. They are divided into geminates and non-geminates. All conjuncts are formed with a chandrakkala (virama) in theory. ക് + ക = ക്ക (kka).

* Geminates : All consonants except aspirates, ര, ഴ, ഷ and ഹ has geminates.

* Non-geminates: These are conjunct consonants formed when two different consonant sounds are pronounced together.

**can change in form with the old lipi (old orthography) which is quite popular.*

### Consonant diacritics

Some consonants have their own markers like the vowels.

* ക് + യ = ക്യ (kya)

* പ് + ര = പ്ര (pra) / pronounced as pṟāvŭ  (പ്റാവ് ) or prāvŭ. depends on the word.

* ശ് + വ = ശ്വ (śva)

  <br>

## Other Notes

1. Malayalam distinguishes half u (ŭ) from an absolute stop. This is crucial in spoken Malayalam. For example, ക്കണ്  and ക്കണ്‍ are pronounced as kkaṇŭ and kkaṇ respectively. 
2. When to use half u and full u? In Malayalam writing, if a word ending in half u is followed by a word starting in a vowel then the half u should be changed to a full u. 
3. While in Malayalam keeps a decent level of phonetic consistency, it is still has a lot of issues with how words are written and pronounced.
