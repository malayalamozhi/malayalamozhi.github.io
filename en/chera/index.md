# The Chera Dynasty and Kerala

* _[മലയാളത്തില്‍ ](/chera/)വായിക്കാം_


<br>The Cheras were the most prominent dynasty of Kerala who were one of the 
mūvēntar (the three crowned rulers). This Empire was referred as Kedalaputo in the Emperor Ashoka's Pali edicts. Not just the mighty Ashoka Empire, but the Greeks and Romans marked the existence of this stupendous empire of Kerala.

With their Naval might, the Cheras conquered the Sea, and regimented maritime trade in the region. The powerful army of Cheras dominated the Coastal expanse and even parts of present day Tamil Nadu.  

The dynasty played a major role in the historical and political sphere of Kerala. The contribution of Cheras can be witnessed in the culture, architecture, art and literature of Kerala. They were the first poets of Kerala, and the Sangam literature opens a detailed image of this marvellous empire.

Kammaṭṭūṟ kaṇṇaṉār, pāṇaṟ, māmūlaṉāṟ, kāppiyāt̲t̲ukāppiyaṉāṟ, ariyil kiḻāṟ are the prominent poets of Sangam era, and the notable Sangam works depicting Cheras are patit̲t̲uppattŭ [Kerala] , akanānūṟ and puṟanānūṟ. Many of the praise poems describes areas ranging from the settlement of Aryan race (Himalaya) up in the North to the tip of South (Kanyakumari), and the victory of Cheras in Sri Lanka.

The Epic journey of this dynasty takes us through generations, where they shaped the political, and cultural vistas of Southern India.
