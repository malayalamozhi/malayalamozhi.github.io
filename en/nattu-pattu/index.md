<br>The  rhythm and melody that was once heard in the paddy fields of Kerala vanished over time. Songs were sung during planting of saplings and during harvest. These songs have played a major ruling in maintaining the uniqueness of the  language and highlighting its richness. 
<br><br>
There were songs to be sung while planting the seedlings, just like the harvest songs which were sung during the harvest. These songs were sung to ease the intensity of labour and to maintain a certain speed and rythm while planting the saplings. Nattu pattu | ñāttŭ pāṭṭŭ | is also known as Pulayarpattu as it was passed down orally among the Pulayar community of Kerala. These songs remind us about the importance of songs in every stratum of the Kerala society.

The following lines are from the great Malayalam poet Ullur's 'Kerala Sahithya Charithram' :- <br><br>

_mārimaḻakaḷ coriñcē ceṟu vayalukaḷ okke nanañcē_ <br>
_pūṭṭiyorukkippaṟañcē ceṟu ñāṟukaḷ keṭṭiyeṟiñcē_ <br>
_ōmala centila mālaceṟu kaṇṇamma kāḷi kaṟumpi_ <br>
_cātta caṭayanmārāya ceṟu maccikaḷellāruṁ vantē_<br>
_vantu nirantavar ninṟē keṭṭi ñāṟēllāṁ keṭṭippakuttē_<br>
_oppattil naṭṭukarēṟānavar kuttiyuṭuttu kuniñcē_<br>
_kaṇṇacceṟumayappōḷ avaḷ ōmalēyennu viḷiccē_<br>
_pāṭṭonnu pāṭīṭṭu vēṇaṁ niṅṅaḷ naṭṭukaraykkaṅṅu kēṟān_<br>
_appōḷōru tattappeṇṇ avaḷ mēmaramēṟikkarañcē_<br>
_mēppōṭṭu nōkkippaṟañcē koccu ōmala kaṭṭicceṟumi_<br>
_tattammappeṇṇē nīyippōḷ iṅke vantoru kāriyaṁ collu_<br><br>

Here one can see the peculiarities of language in nattu pattu. The corresponding 'ñña' in Standard Malayalam is 'ñca' in the above lines. Besides, the corresponding dental 'nna' is 'nta' here, as in vantu (vannu) and nirantavar (nirannavar). Also the usage of iṅke for 'here' as opposed to 'iviṭe' in standard Malayalam is another distinguishable feature of this song. <br><br>
