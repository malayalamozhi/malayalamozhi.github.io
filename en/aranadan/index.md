Aranadan (Eranadan) is a South-Dravidian language belonging to the Malayalam group of languages. It is spoken by the Aranadan tribe in the Malappuram District of Kerala. Even though Aranadan bears many similarities with the Malayalam language, there is Kannada influence in the language.

Aranadan has no writing system of its own. However, the Malayalam script and Ponnani script (Arabi-Malayalam) are used to write this language.

## Comparison with Malayalam

### Structure and Words

In Malayalam, both animate and inanimate nouns use the suffix '-kaḷ' to form a plural. But in Aranadan, this suffix is only applicable to animate nouns. Thus maraṅṅaḷ in Malayalam is kuṟe maram in Aranadan language. The suffix -kaḷ is supplemented by using the adjective kuṟe (many).

For the formation of future tense, both Malayalam and Aranadan use the suffix '-um'. However, Aranadan utilises distinct suffixes for past and present tenses. 

| word | past tense | present tense | future tense |
| :--------: | :----: | :--------: | :----: |
| tinj | tinuppe (tinnu) | tinjuge (tinnunnu)| tinjum (tinnum)|
| tall| talluppe (talli) | tallutu (tallunnu)| tallum (tallum)|
