Reduction in the number of conjunct letters. This simplification does not demand any changes to the existing resources available for Malayalam language, nor does it create any issues to those resources. The simplification calls for deletion of Sanskrit loans with aspirates and other complexities; this does not require changing their spelling. Instead, native Malayalam words or Tadbhavas will replace them. The simplified script will reduce the complexity involved in language technology, and thus increase usage and reliability of such resources. A simplified writing system increases the usability of the script on all platforms. With this reform, keyboard layouts will become much more user-friendly and will drastically increase its popularity among the youth who are accustomed to the ease of using Latin-based keyboard layouts. The use of language in computers will increase with simplified script, as it reduces the complexity of glyph rendering and long, hard-to-pronounce derivations for computer terminology.

Malayalam or Pacha Malayalam is not an ultra purism movement or language extremism. On the contrary, it is a benefaction provided to the future by Malayalam language of the present and past. What is Manipravalam? Bhāṣā saṁskr̥ta yōgō maṇipravāḷaṁ The term Manipravalam is a combination of two words, maṇi, which denotes the Dravidian language of Malayalam and pravāḷam, which denotes the Sanskrit language. Manipravalam is the construction of Sanskrit vocabulary on top of Pure Malayalam’s base to produce a specific style of poetry. In linguistics these kinds of amalgamations are referred to as Macronic Languages. Example: 1,00,000 മുതൽ 50,000 വർഷങ്ങൾക്കു മുമ്പ്, ആദ്യകാല മനുഷ്യ നാഗരികതയുടെ തെളിവുകൾ ഗുഹാചിത്രങ്ങളിലൂടെ കാണാൻ ആരംഭിച്ചു; ഇതും ഭാഷയും തമ്മിലുള്ള ബന്ധം ആർക്കും അറിയില്ല. മസ്തിഷ്കം പെട്ടെന്ന് വികസിക്കുന്നില്ല, എന്നിട്ടും മനുഷ്യർ കൂടുതൽ സങ്കീർണ്ണ ചിന്താഗതിയുള്ളവനും ബുദ്ധിമാനും ആയിത്തീർന്നു. ഭാഷ ഉപയോഗിച്ച് ആയിരിക്കുവോ അവരുടെ മസ്തിഷ്കം വികസിക്കാൻ കാരണമായത്? അതോ അവരുടെ സങ്കീർണ്ണമായ മസ്തിഷ്കം ഭാഷ ഉത്പാദിപ്പിക്കാൻ തുടങ്ങിയോ? You can read the same line in Pure Malayalam under this article In the above sentence, those words which are in bold style came to Malayalam due to Manipravalam. Why Pacha Malayalam? The Sanskrit loan words were popularised as Standard Malayalam with the work done by Sanskrit institutions, and public education that favoured elitism. Majority of these words do not fit into the native phonology of Malayalam language, and Tatsama (original from Sanskrit) were preferred over Tadhbhava words. Tadhbhava words agreed upon the native phonological rules of Malayalam language. This led to the demise of pure vocabulary in the language. Besides, the difficulty in pronouncing these words, made people switch to English vocabulary. Although this act of using Sanskrit loans unnecessarily faced criticism, the mass media and educational institutions haven’t bothered much, all because of Sanskrit being regarded as superior to Malayalam. Loan words are indispensable in languages, However, in case of Malayalam language, the majority of the loans are inessential, and it emphasises the superiority of the lender and makes the language which takes all these loans look weaker. This is where the concept of Pacha Malayalam comes in. A major portion of the pure words in Malayalam are thousands of years old (archaeological and literary evidences). The following image is a hero stone carved in a variant of the Tamil Brahmi script, which was submitted to the Classical Language committee for Malayalam. This came as an article in the India Today Malayalam Magazine (27 October 2010) written by N.G. Nayanatara. This inscription is in Pure Malayalam language, and is almost 2100 years old. Thus, Malayalam transcends the antiquity of many languages like English, French etc. The words such peṭu and tīyan are not found in Tamil, as well the ā (showing direction/distance) being written independently, which is still used, are some evidences of Malayalam’s antiquity. Is Pacha Malayalam a new concept? During the 19th Century, the Pacha Malayalam movement took efforts to reduce the exceeding amount of Sanskrit loans in Malayalam language, mainly through poetry. Malayalam and Sanskrit scholars came forward to prevent Malayalam’s ‘total destruction’. Although, their works known as the Venmani Kavithakal had a slight impact, they were mostly confined to literature. Isn’t Pacha Malayalam just Tamil? Vocabulary alone doesn’t determine a language. How it is used, and which mode, determines a language. Below is a comparative analysis of Scandinavian languages, which are considered as distinct languages. English : What is your name? Swedish : Vad heter du? Danish : Hvad hedder du? Norwegian : Hva heter du? One can see how similar are these languages, yet they are regarded as independent languages.

Instead of deriving complex words for new terminology from Sanskrit, which is usually discarded by Malayalam speakers, words that fit neatly into the native phonology should be derived. This will enrich Malayalam language. Words that came from other languages and agrees with the native phonology such as ēṇi (ladder), tīram (shore), pēṉa (pen) should be retained as Malayalam. If, the argument is that there is no wrong in using exact Sanskrit words in Malayalam, then there is no wrong in using Esperanto’s vocabulary in Malayalam. But this unneeded act of borrowing degrades a Classical language like Malayalam.
